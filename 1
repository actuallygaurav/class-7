"question": {
"ques": "If a new organism is discovered and it is found that it can make food for itself from simple non-living substances found in nature, what will you classify it as–an autotroph or a heterotroph? Give reasons.",
"page_number": "8",
"question_num": "1"
}
},
{
"answer": {
"ans": "An organism that can prepare its food from simple non-living substances will be classified as an autotroph. This is because autotrophic organisms are those organisms which can use simple non-living substances (such as carbon dioxide and water) to produce their own food. These organism can obtain energy for this process through sunlight or chemicals. "

{
"question": {
"ques": "The absence of which of these will not affect photosynthesis–oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll, light? Give reasons.",
"page_number": "8",
"question_num": "1"
}
},
{
"answer": {
"ans": "The absence of oxygen will have no effect on the process of photosynthesis. This is because the photosynthetic process utilises water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and carbohydrate in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight. Thus, oxygen is a product of photosynthesis and is not required for photosynthesis. "
}
},
{
"question": {
"ques": "Do you expect the intensity of light to affect the rate of photosynthesis?",
"page_number": "8",
"question_num": "1"
}
},
{
"answer": {
"ans": "Yes, the intensity of light has a direct affect on the rate of photosynthesis. The chlorophyll molecules that are essential for photosynthesis require a certain intensity of light to perform maximum rate of photosynthesis. Thus, light intensity will certainly affect the photosynthesis rate. "

"question": {
"ques": "A tiger does not eat plants, so it does not depend on plants for food. Is the statement true? Justify your answer.",
"page_number": "8",
"question_num": "1"
}
},
{
"answer": {
"ans": "The given statement is false. Although a tiger does not eat plants, it still depends on the plants. This is because tigers feed on herbivores such as deer which obtain their food from the plants. If the plants are not available, then these herbivores will not get food and consequently, tiger will not get any food. Thus, tiger depends on plant for their food."

{
"question": {
"ques": "All plants are autotrophic. Do you agree? Give reasons.",
"page_number": "8",
"question_num": "1"
}
},
{
"answer": {
"ans": "No, all plants are not autotrophic. Some of the non-green plants such as dodder plants obtain their food from other plants and these plants are heterotrophic plants. Heterophic plants generally do not possess chlorophyll, which inhibits their ability to prepare their own food. Consequently, such plants are not autotrophic. "

{
"question": {
"ques": "In a forest, trees keep taking nutrients from the soil. Therefore, after sometime, the nutrient level will become so low that growth of trees will suffer. Do you agree? Give reasons.",
"page_number": "8",
"question_num": "1"
}
},
{
"answer": {
"ans": "No, the nutrient level in a forest will not become low enough to prevent the growth of trees. This is because in forests, the decaying of dead animals and plants adds nutrients to the soil. This natural process prevents the exhaustion of nutrients and replenishes the nutrients in the soil. "

"question": {
"ques": "Plants need nitrogen to make proteins. Can they absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere?",
"page_number": "8",
"question_num": "1"
}
},
{
"answer": {
"ans": "No, plants can not absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere. Plants can use nitrogen only when it is present in the soil in a soluble form. This soluble nitrogen is absorbed by the roots of the plants and is used by the plants to make proteins."
